Command line: python design.py -i tests/test_files/test_sequences/spike_trim_10.fasta -n 3 -c 3 -r 1000 -co GA -ms 2 -ml 2


Warnings and Errors:


            Checkpoint interval is larger than the number of optimization steps!
            If you are running many steps, you might want to lower the
            checkpoint interval.
